~Button Groups~

- group a series of buttons together (on a single line) in a button group
- Use <div class="btn-group"> with buttons
- Instead of applying button sizes to every button in a group, use class .btn-group-lg for a large button group or the .btn-group-sm for a small button group

- Vertical Button Groups
    - <div class="btn-group-vertical">

- Button Groups Side by Side
    - Button groups are "inline" by default, which makes them appear side by side when you have multiple groups

- Nesting Button Groups & Dropdown Menus
    - Use,  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" data-bs-toggle="dropdown"> for the drop down button
    - and create drop down list like this
    
    <div class="dropdown-menu">
      <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Tablet</a>
      <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Smartphone</a>
    </div>
