~ Bootstrap Grids ~

    - Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.
    - If you do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns
        - column sum should be 12 
            - col 4+ col 4+ col 4 
            - col 8 + col 4

    - Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size
